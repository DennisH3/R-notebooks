# Before you begin

Make sure that you enabled Minio credential injection when you created this server!
Otherwise, you will have a hard time connecting.

![Enable Connection to Minio](kubeflow-minio-option.png)

**In the following, you will need to replace the name `blair-drummond` with your name.**

# Get Connected

We will use `minimal` storage for this example, but the following applies mutatis mutandis to `premium` and `pachyderm`.


```{sh, engine.path = '/bin/bash'}
source /vault/secrets/minio-minimal-tenant1
mc config host add minio-minimal $MINIO_URL $MINIO_ACCESS_KEY $MINIO_SECRET_KEY

# source /vault/secrets/minio-pachyderm-tenant1
# mc config host add minio-pachyderm $MINIO_URL $MINIO_ACCESS_KEY $MINIO_SECRET_KEY

# source /vault/secrets/minio-premium-tenant1
# mc config host add minio-premium $MINIO_URL $MINIO_ACCESS_KEY $MINIO_SECRET_KEY
```

This will configure the access for you.

Then you proceed as in the examples!

## Create your bucket

Replace with your name!

```{sh, engine.path = '/bin/bash'}
mc mb -p minio-minimal/blair-drummond
```

## Upload a file

```{sh, engine.path = '/bin/bash'}
mc cp example.txt minio-minimal/blair-drummond/happy-bird.txt

mc cp -r example-folder minio-minimal/blair-drummond/example-folder
```



## List objects

```{sh, engine.path = '/bin/bash'}
echo private:
mc ls minio-minimal/blair-drummond/

echo
echo shared:
mc ls minio-minimal/shared/blair-drummond/ || true
```


## Download a file

```{sh, engine.path = '/bin/bash'}
mc cp minio-minimal/blair-drummond/happy-bird.txt downloaded-example.txt
```

# Example with RData files

You've seen how to upload, list, and download files.

Using this, you can do cool things like save and upload .Rdata files. For example.


```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Create your .rds file
data("mtcars")
saveRDS(mtcars, "mtcars.rds")
```

## Upload it 

```{sh, engine.path = '/bin/bash'}
mc cp mtcars.rds minio-minimal/blair-drummond/mtcars.rds
```

## Download it

```{sh, engine.path = '/bin/bash'}
mc cp minio-minimal/blair-drummond/mtcars.rds mtcars-two.rds
```

## Load it into R

```{r, fig.show='hold', eval=TRUE, include = TRUE}
mtcars_two <- readRDS("mtcars-two.rds")

head(mtcars_two)
```

That's it!
